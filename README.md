hi so to be able to fully run this website you need to pip install all of the library in the rquriment file 
(i have that done , but in case that my inital install didnt work on your system u have to install it manually)
also you need to install this library as welll "flask_session"  , write in your terminal "pip install flask_session"

kind regards mohamad
